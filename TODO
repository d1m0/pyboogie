High-level TODO:
- read "This is boogie 2" and make careful notes on:
    - parametric polymorphism, types modeling etc..
    - update grammar/ast/interp to as I go through
    - add explicit type-checking pass?

Concrete TODO:
TODOs for 
>>> 

TODOs for supporting more of language:
    - where do we check saneness of the 5 namespace constraints (types, var+consts, functions, procedures, attributes)? do we need to keep track of all of them?
    - add attributes to AST nodes for: "local-variable declaration, assert and assume statement,
        procedure specification clause, loop invariant, and quantifier" and 
    - add triggers to quantifier ASTs
    - for map types, as part of type-checking check that any type var is mentioned in the domain type.
    - check type vars in Map type def are distinct
    - fix paths to be list of Locs == (BB, idx)
    - Change LabelT to Union[str, int]
    - rename FuncInterp to MapVal, decide how to specify these values
    - maybe remove eval.py? Seems like old code

Book-keeping
    - make a note somewhere grammar doesn't yet support Unicode
    - fix all function/var cases to caml case
    - convert all variable "# type: .." annotations to ": Type"
    - check Pep-8 compliance
    - Once support for Procedures is added, should we re-name Function class to Procedure?
    - Add integration testing
    - rename ssa.py to ssa_env.py to better reflect contents
    - add tests for filterInvariantNetworks

Re-write cleanup TODOS:
    - re-write z3_embed and perhaps make it independent from z3 (make everything agnosting to SMT, use smtlib2 library instead?)
    - remove pyro dependency
    - fix the nondet path types mess - too complex right now
    - after paths become list of locs rather than bbs, simplify invariant networks.py

4. Factor out SMT generation so its modular (can substitute any SMT inside)
5. Remove out-of-process z3 (and pyro dependency).
6. Remove unnecessary utils?

Testing notes:

Needs:
pyboogie/interp.py  - rename/simplify FuncInterp. Need better modelling for maps and polymorphic types.

Re-write/simplify:
pyboogie/paths.py    - simplify paths?
pyboogie/z3_embed.py  - remove Pyro dependency?
